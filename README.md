Inventory Management System — Project Description

I developed a full-stack Inventory Management System using React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing inventory records and a robust server-side architecture to ensure data consistency, validation, and security.

On the frontend, React.js was used to build dynamic and responsive UI components for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting inventory data. The frontend communicates with the backend through well-structured RESTful APIs, enabling smooth data exchange in JSON format.

On the backend, Spring Boot was used to implement business logic and expose REST endpoints. Hibernate with JPA was used as the ORM layer to map Java entities to database tables and handle persistence. All data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. Input validation was implemented to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid entries.

The system supports complete CRUD operations, structured API responses, and proper exception handling. This ensures reliable data processing, maintainability, and scalability of the application.

Overall, the project demonstrates strong understanding of full-stack development, REST API design, data persistence, validation, and modern Java web application architecture.
